His studio albums and live performances set forth a vision that connects the dots in the vast space between LCD Soundsystem and Leon Russell, pulsating with dance rock energy, but with smart, earthy songwriting to match. It has led to numerous high profile appearances, ranging from Carnegie Hall to Pickathon, Mountain Jam to Bonnaroo, while headlining shows coast to coast.\r\n\r\nMarco Benevento’s latest LP, The Story of Fred Short, is some of his finest and most adventurous work to date—a maestro making “bold indie rock” says Brooklyn Vegan.  The collection is the follow-up to 2014’s Swift, which found Benevento singing for the first time and honing his psych rock and late night dance party sensibilities. The Story Of Fred Short is a continuation of this exploration with Benevento citing everything from Harry Nilsson, Manu Chau and Gorillaz as inspiration.\r\n\r\nDivided into two sides, The Story Of Fred Short oozes with Benevento’s relentless creative spirit in songwriting, performance and production.  Side A is stuffed with mesmerizing dance rock gold.  Marco doubles down on the groove using a rare Casio drum machine that’s become a recurring muse, in addition to a live drummer. The B Side tells the story of Fred Short in seven chapters of wild, heavy rock n’ roll.  Fred Short was a Native American man known for throwing musical bacchanals on the property Marco now lives on in the Catskills.\r\n\r\nAs anybody who’s seen Marco Benevento perform can attest, with eyes closed, smile wide across his face and fingers free-flowing across the keys, he’s a satellite to the muse. With a devout and growing fan-base, Benevento is an artist whose story is only beginning to unfold.","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/MarcoBenevento","id":"2017-6760575","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6760575.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6760575-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6760575-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6760575.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"Marco Benevento","sort_order_within_tier":150,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEVdFQNIvuI","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/marco.benevento/"},{"home_town":"Boise, ID","music_url":"https://soundcloud.com/tisper/sets/sleepy-creature-unmastered-mp3s/s-AlQrc","code":"2017-6725769","website_url":null,"instagram_url":"https://www.instagram.com/tispermusic/?hl=en","tier":3,"genres":["Acoustic","Experimental ","Singer-Songwriter"],"bio":"Tisper is a fantasy-folk project fronted by Samwise Carlson in Boise, ID.

Tasked with introducing Wondervisions, Delicate Steve's beguiling debut record of highly evocative and emotionally concise guitar-driven songs, Luaka Bop, the seminal David Byrne-owned New York indie label, balked. There was the music to get to; itself essentially reference-less and unqualifiedly unique. But what of the guy who created it? The guitarist who wrote the whole thing, who played every instrument. An enormous unknown talent without an attendant backstory to match the spectral and boundless qualities of his music. Enter Chuck Klosterman. The celebrated writer was brought on to completely fabricate a biography based on a band and album he was asked not to listen to. \r\n\r\nWhile the record racked up high praise from outlets including The New York Times and NPR, nearly everything music fans read about Delicate Steve was a fiction. Listeners were left to the music alone to determine who Steve was. \r\n\r\nAs is often the case, some of the first people to recognize Delicate Steve's music were fellow artists who became vocal supporters, as the young guy from upstate New Jersey began to develop a growing fanbase in small New York clubs like Glasslands, Union Pool, and Mercury Lounge. Following the 2012 release of Positive Force, Delicate Steve had cornered the status of 'your favorite band's favorite band', as Steve himself became a fixture in and an on-demand collaborator among disparate scenes, players, and bands, making some of the most celebrated and forward thinking music today: Co-signs and work with David Byrne, Dirty Projectors, tUnE-yArDs, Mac DeMarco, Dr. Dog, and elder statesmen like Lee Ranaldo and Built to Spill. Likely the only guitarist alive who will cut records with Sondre Lerche and Death Grip's Zach Hill. Handpicked to open a sold out North American tour for Tame Impala. And most recently, providing guitar on Paul Simon's new record.  \r\n\r\nThis is Steve, Delicate Steve's first new record in 4 years, and first for the ANTI- imprint, is an articulation of this spirit. Joy. Love. Positivity. Perseverance. Meditation. It's real. It's pure. This, is Steve. \r\n\r\nMelody begins with the needle drop on This is Steve, and it's this hallmark as a songwriter on display in tune after tune that has defined all of Delicate Steve's work. It's his incredible capacity to write wordless songs that are impossible not to sing along to. He works in no genre, there are no words, but there is never a question as to what he is saying. \r\n\r\nTunes like \"Animals,\" \"Help,\" and \"Nightlife,\" establish their hooks immediately, and drop you with Steve as he runs alongside leopards, scales a Western peak, nurses a boozy Kingston come-down, before clocking out at under three minutes and depositing you somewhere else on a technicolor continuum. Throughout the set, Steve's guitar melodies rise and crest, unguarded expressions of wonderment and positivity.  \r\n\r\nSteve produced and played all the instruments on this record. He created it as an introduction from himself to you, and named it appropriately.  If there is a question as to who This is Steve’s creator is, you'll find it imbued in these ten songs. As he has done from the start, Steve lets the music speak for itself. Without a word.","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/delicatesteve","id":"2017-6561823","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6561823.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6561823-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6561823-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6561823.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"Delicate Steve","sort_order_within_tier":140,"video_url":null,"facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/DelicateSteve/?fref=ts"},{"home_town":"Asbury Park, NJ","music_url":"https://soundcloud.com/search?q=the%20bouncing%20souls","code":"2017-6689896","website_url":"www.bouncingsouls.com","instagram_url":"https://www.instagram.com/bouncingsoulsnj/","tier":1,"genres":["Punk","Rock"],"bio":"You can count the number of bands who've stayed together for almost 30 years on two hands, and you can use just one to count those who've consistently released quality material for the duration of those almost three decades.

Each new record from The Growlers has something gripping enough that makes it as exciting as a debut. The Growlers swooned us back in 2013 with “One Million Lovers” and Gilded Pleasures, those “Humdrum Blues” with Hung At Heart, and then, within the more recent couple of years, that magnificently depressing “Good Advice” on Chinese Fountain. We’ve been seeing The Growlers for a while now, and we know all their tricks: bashful love songs softly cradled by opiate-euphoria, kick-shit pub songs aggravated by rum and amphetamines, and, of course, how genuinely they’ve always related to the everyday man when the going gets tough. But something has been different with The Growlers lately. They’ve been coming home later at night smelling like cheap perfume and whiskey with a slick new Members Only jacket, and they’re not caressing our needs as much anymore. At this point, they know how obsessed with them we’ve become, and they don’t feel obligated to fill our every need. Now, they’ve decided they’re going to do what they want to do. They’re going to stay out and drink for however long they want. They’re going to pick up new moods and scents even if you don’t like them. They’re going to flirt with something new if it fancies them, and they’re going to turn up their fuzz and synthesizers however fucking loudly they want.\r\n\r\nYou knew this when they came through the door a few weeks ago with “City Club” and realized who they’ve been hanging out with. Julian Casablancas of The Strokes produced the new album for the boys and have helped them out with a new, slick, New York–esque style. Sounds off this record spawn in the hours of the late night, and there is a more cock-out attitude, distant from what we’ve been used to since our affair began with The Growlers. But in the middle of all this late-night musk and confusion, they revive our faith with “When You Were Made” and let us know that that old sweetheart singing us those affectionate songs is still in there. It still makes us think: That sounded like my beloved Growlers, but everything else has changed. Is this just a phase? Moving through “Rubber & Bone” and hopping over “The Daisy Chain,” we end up in “World Unglued,” and it starts to make sense. Here, these new moods and swings start to come together with those old favorite sentiments. It’s still our one, true love, The Growlers—they just need room to try on new garbs and taste new, dark subject matter. And with this, it’s all right. We let them follow with venting about “another bar fight in a neon light” and “high-ass women who don’t see me” in “Neverending Line”—all the shit they’ve had to put up with as a touring rock band. \r\n","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/theGROWLERS","id":"2017-6769608","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6769608.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6769608-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6769608-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6769608.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"The Growlers","sort_order_within_tier":10,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50R8rkzkhk&t=181s","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/losGrowlers/"},{"home_town":"Brooklyn, NY","music_url":"https://thedig.bandcamp.com/music","code":"2017-6758466","website_url":"www.thedigmusic.com","instagram_url":"www.instagram.com/thedig","tier":2,"genres":["Alternative","Indie","Rock"],"bio":"From the beginning, The Dig have been a classic band’s band, and a true collaboration: three longtime friends, three songwriters, two singers in a true dual frontman setup, all individuals but all woven more and more tightly together as they have evolved. In a world that rewards drama, reckless moves and often-overwrought narrative twists, The Dig have bucked that trend by focusing on, well, the work: writing song after song to cast off more than they keep, and keep only the best.  The Dig do a lot, and they do it the right way — building brick by brick, writing constantly, touring steadily, and most crucially, pushing themselves creatively to make better and better records.  Which brings us, of course, to Bloodshot Tokyo, a record rich with ambition and a bright, irresistible ease.  “In the past I think we’ve tried to create a mindset of writing ‘for The Dig’”, says guitarist/keyboard playing Erick Eiser, “so as to create something cohesive.  This time I think we really freed ourselves from that, and just wrote.”  They made the most of their interconnectedness as a way to push themselves forward, writing what singer and bassist Emile Mosseri describes as “elaborate demos” for most of the songs.\r\n\r\nArrangements were fully worked out, ideas were explored and re-explored before they sat down to record.  Emile continues, “It’s not hard to write songs separately, but there’s a thing that happens where I’ll sometimes have the other guys in my head, even when I’m writing by myself.  So in a way, we’re kind of always writing together even when we’re writing alone. We all grew up playing in different bands together since we were little kids, and have toured with and were inspired by all kinds of different bands for years. I feel like writing this record was the sum of all those years.  It’s the most wide spanning stylistically and colorful of our records, and also sounds the most like us.”    \r\n\r\nThe result is a tremendously confident record, and one that’s far punchier than its predecessors. Even with veritable piles of songs to choose from, it feels oddly apt that Bloodshot Tokyo opens with the brief snippet that is “Ordinary Mind”. It is a sparkling, hugely inviting riff and a refrain that paves the way, just a small fragment too good to let go of.  “Jet Black Hair” follows and is an undeniable A-sider, putting the band’s pop instincts front and center, never shying away from the groove but never weighed down by it, either.  Lead single “Simple Love” moves stealthily, winking to just a little something retro but dancing across genres in an exhilaratingly modern way.        \r\n\r\nAs a band, The Dig made a choice to turn somewhat from the more ambient sounds of their earlier songs, using those tones as texture to drive songs with other foundations, rather than making it the focal point.  Drummer Mark Demiglio, The Dig’s relative newcomer, brings a modern pop counterweight to The Dig’s moodier side, and it shows.  Songs like “Pool of Rotting Water” underline that change, going downright beat-driven with just the right amount of glam for a band that is, at its heart, very much a rock band.","twitter_url":"http://www.twitter.com/thedigisup","id":"2017-6758466","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6758466.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6758466-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6758466-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6758466.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"The Dig","sort_order_within_tier":1030,"video_url":"https://youtu.be/Ab_MzDv-xVU","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/thedig"},{"home_town":"Portland, OR","music_url":null,"code":"2017-6740678","website_url":"https://sites.google.com/site/yellowelectric/","instagram_url":"https://www.instagram.com/grouperepuorg/","tier":1,"genres":["Experimental "],"bio":"Grouper is a recording and performing project by Liz Harris.

They employ multiple synthesizers and guitars to create a danceable, youthful rock sound. Wrinkles songs range from dark and ominous dream pop to upbeat rock and roll. Drawing influences from a wide range of artists such as The Strokes, LCD Soundsystem, Beach House, and Modest Mouse, Wrinkles builds a sonic foundation based on interlocking hooks and powerful melodies.  \r\n\r\nThere is a depth to the name Wrinkles that one would be hard-pushed to grasp in a mere glance. Not unlike their music, the moniker is immediately amusing and lighthearted, but on pulling back the layers there is an astounding wisdom that far exceeds the quintets mean age of 22. The band was started in summer 2012, and has since been cultivating an energetic live set full of eclectic outfits and crowd interaction. They are now based in Missoula, MT, and just released their debut album, Separation Anxiety, which they have been touring around the country in support of. \r\n\r\nNamed for both the geographical dispersion that the band has faced and the lyrical themes of disconnect that comprise it, the full-length is as playful as it is hard-hitting and thought-provoking. Sonically, it is bright and energetic, but the lyrics are serious and sincere as Wrinkles ponders themes of disjointed realities, societal pressures, and the struggles of moving into adulthood. This youthful, pensive approach is one that epitomizes Wrinkles.","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/wrinklesrock","id":"2017-6323046","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6323046.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6323046-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6323046-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6323046.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"Wrinkles","sort_order_within_tier":2380,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm7fgLmYSgs","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/wrinklesrock/"},{"home_town":"Austin, TX / Los Angeles, CA","music_url":"http://thiswilldestroyyou.bandcamp.com/album/another-language","code":"2017-6760462","website_url":"http://www.thiswilldestroyyou.net/","instagram_url":"https://www.instagram.com/thiswilldestroyyoumusic/","tier":1,"genres":["Ambient","Post- Rock"],"bio":"Since 2004, This Will Destroy You has been forging some of the world's most brutal, dynamic, and precariously visceral instrumental rock. In addition to a vigorous tour schedule, their celebrated discography and critically renowned soundtrack work for feature films and documentaries have earned them a sizable and fervent international following. Another Language, TWDY's fourth full length LP, marks their euphonious return from a prolonged vacuous dark period that threatened to break both the band and the members themselves. Rather than be stifled by their experience TWDY were atomized and subsequently made anew, emerging with a revived energy and reinforced sense of solidarity. As a result, Another Language captures the band at its most potent, honed, and utterly powerful form yet, displaying an edified unity and graduated sense of song-writing, tonal complexity, and studio prowess.\r\n\r\nTWDY's new found clarity of vision would come after a state of near dissolution that ensued after the massive success of their 2006 debut Young Mountain and 2008's eponymous follow up. Personal struggles, growing pains, the loss of band members, and a series of close, untimely tragedies set the tone for what would be the band's darkest and most introspective album yet, 2011's Tunnel Blanket. The following two years stress tested the band to the point of ruin; consecutive continent-hopping tours as well as the pressures of matching their previous two albums' accomplishments took a nearly unbearable toll. TWDY's spirits were lifted when both independent filmmakers and Hollywood began to eye their discography for prominent placement in several critically acclaimed films, including the Oscar-winning Moneyball. The arrival of 2013's Live in Reykjavik triple LP was warmly received by fans and critics alike, further rejuvenating the band after years of relentless, grinding tours. In October of 2013 TWDY returned to Elmwood Recording, once again working with engineer John Congleton, fully prepared to construct their next work from the inside out.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening moments of Another Language it is clear that the band has achieved its aim. The reflective opening dialogue of guitar, choral-like organ, and shimmering Rhodes on New Topia float over nuanced warbling swells of tape before being completely disintegrated by a shock wave of blistering guitars, bass, and locomotive poly-rhythms. These peaks and valleys of emotive dynamism are expertly guided by the dexterous drum work of Alex Bhore, who offers up droves of ghost-notes and compounded cadences that energize the album with a fully realized freedom of movement. The band's frequency spectrum now extends to new heights via adornments of tubular bells, microcassette manipulations, and washes of tuned feedback by guitarists Christopher King and Jeremy Galindo while bassist Donovan Jones ensures that the band's roots dig deep into the netherworld of sub-frequencies. An earthy realism can be heard throughout Another Language's nine tracks, as if all of its sound sources have been so heavily disguised under layers signal manipulation that their original form is weathered beyond recognition. Composition duties were shared equally more than ever, offering TWDY an opportunity to delve deeper into the writing process with an unprecedented level of cohesion.\r\n\r\nForced to redefine themselves as individuals, artists, and as a unit, TWDY's Another Language exudes a corporeal sense of the formidable journey, which was overcome in order to arrive at their newly galvanized state of confidence and artistry.","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/tunnelblanket","id":"2017-6760462","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6760462.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6760462-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6760462-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6760462.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"This Will Destroy You","sort_order_within_tier":200,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NTAzvtyRYs","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thiswilldestroyyou/"},{"home_town":"Seattle, WA","music_url":"https://soundcloud.com/wildpowwers/sets/hugs-and-kisses-and-other-things","code":"2017-6557213","website_url":"http://wildpowwers.com","instagram_url":"http://www.instagram.com/wildpowwers","tier":3,"genres":["Indie","Punk","Rock"],"bio":"WILD POWWERS are 3 Seattle kids who “specialize in the sort of carefree grunge riff-rock that gets better the dirtier it gets.

In a landscape governed by ceaseless babble, flashing lights, and hollow lies, Eagle harmonizes into the void so we don’t have to.\r\n\r\nOn this descent into the digital trenches, Eagle teams up with British producer, Paul White for Hella Personal Film Festival. Released on Mello Music Group, the full collaboration finds White behind the boards, conjuring a psychedelic strain of soul-funk, booming drums, and 21st century crate-digging in tropical attics of the imagination. On the microphone, the Chicago-bred, LA-based, Eagle artfully breaks down the banalities and perils of the modern condition.\r\n\r\nRecorded in London, Hella Personal Film Festival continues where his 2014 masterpiece, Dark Comedy left off. It’s anxiety-riddled but whimsical, addicted to and scornful of social media, stuffed with old wrestling in-jokes and film snippets. Self-aware admissions blend into attacks on societal double standards.\r\n\r\nKnown for alchemical solo work and collaborations with Danny Brown, Homeboy Sandman, and Mos Def, this is White’s first proper union with Eagle. The two artists bonded over the notion of diversity. The process started out with rough demos, which White ended up finishing in post-production—playing guitar, drums, bass, keyboards, percussion and pieces of wood found in a forest. Its genius ultimately comes from the pair mining a deep vein of emotional content—a discussion of the things we feel that you don’t say. A movie that hits so accurately it’s almost uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThese are tense anthems for the vulnerable, consecrations to black people with rich internal lives, agnostic prayers for those grappling with pain. They’re emotional landmines leavened by the wry bleakness usually only found in great stand-up comedians. Eagle exists in the lineage of They Might Be Giants and Richard Pryor, Freestyle Fellowship and his longtime friend and collaborator, Hannibal Burress.\r\n\r\nWithin the first act, the plot becomes clear. See “Admitting the Endorphin,” where Eagle raps, “I chase my poison tail and get so high that voices fail.” These are the movies he’d make it he knew how to make movies. Surreal vignettes about waking up with burrito hangovers in hotels you don’t recognize, wondering if you remembered to charge your phone. Aesop Rock and Hemlock Ernst (Sam Herring of Future Islands) pop up as fellow travelers.\r\n\r\nNo one is better than Eagle at capturing the nauseous disorientation of day-to-day life. The deluge of sports highlights, unread texts and Twitter notifications. The compulsive need to check your phone at red lights and pauses in conversation. But his incisiveness extends far beyond observational humor. “Smiling (Quirky Race Doc)” examines the slights and casual bigotry of daily interaction. “A Short About a Guy That Dies Every Night” is a morbid rumination on death.\r\n\r\nThese are the returns after long dark nights of the soul. When the noises are loud, the lights are off, and the armor is pierced. Short films that loop over and over again, as soon as you close your eyes.","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/mike_eagle","id":"2017-6785417","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6785417.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6785417-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6785417-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6785417.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"Open Mike Eagle","sort_order_within_tier":155,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ckB65nS3yk","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/mikeeagleraps/"},{"home_town":"San Francisco, CA","music_url":"https://deafheavens.bandcamp.com/album/new-bermuda","code":"2017-6762381","website_url":"http://www.deafheaven.com/","instagram_url":"https://www.instagram.com/deafheavenband/","tier":1,"genres":["Metal","Post- Rock","Shoegaze"],"bio":"Deafheaven is a California-based act that has garnered acclaim for their signature hybrid sound of black metal, shoegaze, and post-rock.

It was produced, engineered, mixed, and mastered by Jack Shirley who has worked with the band on their previous releases.

It's significant that this is the first fully home-recorded WHY? album since the project's 2003 debut. Made mostly in Wolf's studio and co-produced by his brother Josiah, the result is obsessive, of course, but also intimate, and flush with warmth and looseness. But the biggest transformation is a bit subtler. After years of eying his world, in part, with a cynical squint, Wolf here learns a new mode. While Moh Lhean never stoops to outright optimism, it chronicles our hero finding peace in the unknowing, trading the wry smirk for a holy shrug, and looking past corporeal pain for something more cosmic and, rest assured, equally weird. \r\n\r\nDon't bother asking Wolf what \"Moh Lhean\" means. He won't tell you. It's the name of his home studio, where friends and family—WHY? regulars Josiah, Matt Meldon, Doug McDiarmid, Liz Wolf, and Ben Sloan, plus a handful of Ohioans—gathered to record this (and also at Josiah's studio, dubbed El Armando). And like the titles of Alopecia and Mumps, Etc., it references a concrete thing that Wolf experienced. Most likely it's something to do with letting go, rebirth, coming home to a familiar feeling, or venturing out to discover a new one. Or maybe it's just a yoga pose. But there's something in Moh Lhean, even with all its mysteries and all its differences, that's both ephemeral and distinctive, like something the Wolf Brothers might've heard on a praise album in their father's synagogue as kids, or on some '60s hippie LP they thrifted in their teens, or, perhaps, on the other side of the records they've been making their entire adult lives. Thus, it seems appropriate to conclude with some words sung on the very first song of WHY?'s sixth album, Moh Lhean: \"One thing, there is no other. Only this, there is no other.... Just layers of this one thing.\"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/whywithaqmark","id":"2017-6765155","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6765155.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6765155-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6765155-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6765155.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"WHY?","sort_order_within_tier":50,"video_url":null,"facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/whywithaquestionmark"},{"home_town":"Oakland, CA","music_url":"https://soundcloud.com/tru-thoughts/sets/the-seshen-flames-figures/s-fh9iL","code":"2017-6758035","website_url":"http://www.theseshen.com/","instagram_url":"https://www.instagram.com/theseshen/","tier":2,"genres":["Electronic ","R&B"],"bio":"The Seshen is a San Francisco Bay Area-based seven-piece led by singer/lyricist Lalin St. Juste and bassist/producer Akiyoshi Ehara. Their forward-thinking sound combines synthesizers, drum machines, live percussion, and entrancing harmonies to create an unmistakable fusion of R&B, synth-pop, and electronic music. St. Juste and Ehara are joined by five remarkable bandmates to create their multidimensional music: vocalist Kash Rockland, drummer Chris Thalmann, keyboard/synth player Mahesh Rao, percussionist Mirza Kopelman, and sampler Kumar Butler. They take inspiration from across the musical spectrum; their individual influences range from recognizable artists (Erykah Badu, Jai Paul, James Blake, Radiohead, and Broadcast) to genres and eras that don’t initially appear to fit together (hip hop, indie rock, early electronica, and 70’s dub). Their unique alchemy of seemingly disparate sounds has led fans and critics alike to describe the band as defying categorization.\r\n\r\nOn the cusp of a new era, the band is looking forward to releasing Flames & Figures, their full-length debut with Tru Thoughts, on October 14th, 2016. The album has been two years in the making and marks an evolution in The Seshen’s distinctive sound. Narrated by St. Juste’s lyrical stream of consciousness, Flames & Figures explores themes of femininity, power, illusion, and loss, as she draws on both her personal experiences and the world of her imagination. \r\n\r\nThe band remains in high demand, supporting live shows with Hiatus Kaiyote, tUnE-yArDs, Thundercat, Petite Noir and many more. Last year The Seshen played Harlem’s legendary Apollo Theater and has plans for a string of U.S. dates in the fall of 2016. They are also looking forward to touring Europe in March 2017 after recently signing with booking agency 13 Artists (Tame Impala, Alabama Shakes, Portishead).","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/theseshen","id":"2017-6758035","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6758035.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6758035-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6758035-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6758035.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"The Seshen","sort_order_within_tier":1150,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaVb3WSMchc","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/theseshen"},{"home_town":"Boise, ID","music_url":"https://soundcloud.com/stations/artist/hillfolknoir","code":"2017-6790736","website_url":"www.hillfolknoir.com","instagram_url":"http://instagram.com/hillfolknoir","tier":2,"genres":["Acoustic","Alternative","Americana"],"bio":"Fronted by singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Travis Ward, Hillfolk Noir is a trio of neo-traditionalists playing traditional music on traditional instruments for non-traditional times.

Most tragically, the passing of his brother. 'So Many Hoops/So Little Time' deals with grief in different spectrums –– the album ranges both sonically & lyrically from whimsical space-pop to crushing acoustic vulnerability. There isn’t a singular concept or message, but the deeper you delve into Hideout’s world the more you feel nostalgia and a sense of loss.\r\n\r\nHideout began as a recording project. The majority of 'Rookie' was recorded while on the road with Cults. Rodriguez took advantage of the downtime by tracking songs in hotel rooms or at friends’ homes. Fast-forward to the forthcoming 'So Many Hoops. . .' –– mixed by Loren Humphrey (Nice As Fuck, Cults, Guards) at Stockholm Syndrome Sound Studio in Bushwick, NY –– the recording process was far more linear than 'Rookie'. The album evolved predominantly at Rodriguez’s apartment while the surrounding turmoil of loss sunk in. Emotionally charged, he turned to the art of songwriting & storytelling to help navigate through the many answerless questions.\r\n\r\nNow a fully realized band, Hideout has been performing live with a rotating cast of New York musicians over the past year.

Whether they're playing at a backyard house party in Texas, a punk-rock dive bar or a sprawling country music festival, crowds take notice. People put down their phones, pick up their drinks and start dancing.\r\n\r\n“Whiskey Shivers isn't just the five of us on stage, it’s everybody in the room,\" Fitzgerald says. \"We try to bring everybody into the moment and get them to realize there's no wall between us and the crowd. We're all in this together, and we're all here to have a good time. We'll do our best to facilitate it, but it takes all of us to make it happen. When you start to feel that, you can't help but feel a little attachment and become invested in the show. You realize, 'Oh, I'm here to have good time too!’”\r\n\r\nDespite their joyful demeanor, the guys in Whiskey Shivers aren't pretending that life is always easy. Far from it, Fitzgerald explains. Their new self-titled album, produced by fellow roots music boundary-pusher Robert Ellis, is heavy with traditional bluegrass themes and imagery lamenting universal struggles - work, pain, sin, regret and death.\r\n\r\nIt's in the contrast where Whiskey Shivers' music shines. They infuse their songs with punk rock energy and a darkly comical light-heartedness, stretching the bluegrass genre to fit whatever they feel is right. For them, being happy is a conscious choice, and making fun of life's struggles is part of their philosophy.\r\n\r\n\"We're all going through shit all the time. We recognize that life's tough,\" Fitzgerald says. \"We try to write songs that recognize the hard times that we all share. When you put your problems out on the table where everyone can see them, it doesn't really have the same power over you any more, and you can start to acknowledge it, separate yourself from it, and go on with your life. Try to take a night where you can forget about your problems and just feel good, have a good time with your friends, make new friends, and be part of a little community for a while.\"\r\n\r\nThat sort of musical honesty is what brought together the ragtag group of string players from small towns around the country to Austin, TX, where Whiskey Shivers was formed when stand-up bassist Andrew VanVoorhees answered a dubious Craigslist ad from a man named \"Bob\" looking to form a bluegrass band.\r\n\r\nThe full lineup now consists of Bobby Fitzgerald (vocals, fiddle) from Dundee, NY, Andrew VanVoorhees (bass, vocals) from Prineville, OR, James Gwyn (washboards), Jeff “Horti” Hortillosa (vocals, guitar) from Middlesboro, KY, and James Bookert (banjo) from Georgetown, TX.","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/WhiskeyShivers","id":"2017-6785640","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6785640.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6785640-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6785640-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6785640.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"Whiskey Shivers","sort_order_within_tier":1390,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC6DuckeJUM","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/whiskeyshivers/"},{"home_town":"Spokane, WA","music_url":"https://mercybrownofficial.bandcamp.com","code":"2017-6234517","website_url":"http://mercy-brown.com/","instagram_url":"https://www.instagram.com/mercyfulbrown/","tier":3,"genres":["Alternative","Metal"],"bio":"Mercy Brown is an American metal band from Spokane, Washington. Formed in 2010, the current lineup includes Sera Hatchett (vocals), Chris Tanaka Canwell (guitar), Josh Schultz (bass), and Lunden Herndon (drums). Complimented by a vast array of influences, Mercy Brown is known for their dynamic musical presence, ranging from blackened death metal, to punk rock, to dark ambience. The diverse nature of their music has allowed them to play shows with Machine Head, Mushroomhead, 3 Inches of Blood, Castle, Hanzel und Gretyl, Lord Dying, Witch Mountain, and The Atlas Moth, to name a few. They are currently playing shows throughout the Pacific Northwest in support of their self-titled debut album.\r\n\r\nMercy Brown first garnered attention outside of Spokane with the release of their self-titled, three track EP in 2012. The EP eventually reached #1 on progressive rock and metal college radio stations throughout the Inland Northwest, prompting the band to begin focusing on recording and producing new material. Between 2013 and the beginning of 2015, the band focused on writing and recording new songs, while also welcoming new member Lunden Herndon, who replaced former drummer Devin Beedle in June of 2014.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, 2015, Mercy Brown released their highly anticipated, self-titled debut album. The album was recorded and mixed at guitarist Chris Tanaka Canwell’s studio Birdhouse Squirrel in Spokane, Washington. Highlighted by the singles, ‘Red and Yellow’, ‘In the Dark’, ‘One (The Edge of)’, and ‘News Complaint’, the album has seen positive reviews and was quickly put into radio rotations across North America and Europe.","twitter_url":"https://mobile.twitter.com/MercyfulBrown","id":"2017-6234517","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6234517.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6234517-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6234517-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6234517.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"Mercy Brown","sort_order_within_tier":2440,"video_url":"http://youtu.be/58W4bYy66sw","facebook_url":"https://m.facebook.com/mercybrownofficial/"},{"home_town":"Seattle, WA","music_url":"https://greatgrandpa.bandcamp.com/","code":"2017-6459321","website_url":null,"instagram_url":"https://www.instagram.com/instagwamps/","tier":2,"genres":["Garage","Pop","Other"],"bio":"Putting Great Grandpa in a neat box tied up with a bow would be a challenge.

One year after forming the influential San Diego instrumental group Tristeza, songwriter & multi-instrumentalist Jimmy LaValle founded THE ALBUM LEAF, a solo studio project turned full-fledged live band. The diversity of THE ALBUM LEAF’s music is second only to the diversity of the music that has inspired LaValle through the years – the artist has named everything from German Ambient/Pysch bands like Can, Cluster and Harmonia to traditional mariachi music, electronic music and Brian Eno as some of his primary influences – and it’s clear that THE ALBUM LEAF is unafraid of thinking outside the box, both as an individual artist & within the larger scope of modern music.\r\n\r\nOver time, THE ALBUM LEAF (now based in Los Angeles) has grown from a side endeavor to LaValle's main focus. The project’s first releases, An Orchestrated Rise To Fall (1999) and One Day I’ll Be On Time (2001), intertwined field recordings, Rhodes piano, and a nuanced treatment of texture with mature songwriting and dense, evocative atmospheres. Following these records, which put THE ALBUM LEAF on the map for critics and fans worldwide, Icelandic band Sigur Rós discovered LaValle and took THE ALBUM LEAF on tour with them in the US, garnering the band wide exposure and recognition.\r\n\r\nFollowing a European and a second US tour with Sigur Rós, LaValle left Tristeza to devote his full attention to THE ALBUM LEAF, and soon produced the highly acclaimed releases Seal Beach (2003, Acuarela discos) and In A Safe Place (2004, Sub Pop / City Slang). Since then, THE ALBUM LEAF's influence has continued to grow. LaValle has released two more well-received full-lengths as well as tens of other releases ranging from soundtracks to collaborations with artists such as Bright Eyes & Mark Kozelek, further establishing THE ALBUM LEAF as a household name in the world of modern rock music and beyond. THE ALBUM LEAF has toured extensively across the globe, and many of the band's songs have appeared on TV shows including Scandal, Sons of Anarchy, Suits, and more. In 2016, the band partnered with renowned label Relapse Records for the release of the group’s sixth studio album and first since 2010’s A Chorus Of Storytellers (Sub Pop).\r\n\r\nNow, nearly twenty years into a career that has seen LaValle exercising his creativity across the realms of film scoring, sound collage, and rock music, via instrumental and vocal-driven compositions alike, LaValle & THE ALBUM LEAF’s newly solidified lineup are poised to deliver yet another sonic triumph with 2016’s Between Waves. The album was born out of a thorough reinvention of LaValle's creative process and approach: Between Waves is THE ALBUM LEAF's first full-length record to be recorded with the band's current lineup, and was written with greater emphasis on the group dynamic (the album was also entirely recorded and produced by LaValle and the band).","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/thealbumleaf","id":"2017-6760782","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6760782.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6760782-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6760782-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6760782.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"The Album Leaf","sort_order_within_tier":90,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e90d_dr-FwI","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/TheAlbumLeaf/"},{"home_town":"Seattle, WA","music_url":"https://sassyblack.bandcamp.com/album/no-more-weak-dates","code":"2017-6576075","website_url":"http://www.catharriswhite.com","instagram_url":"https://www.instagram.com/sassyblackcat/","tier":2,"genres":["Funk","Hip-hop","Psychedelic ","R&B","Soul"],"bio":"SassyBlack is a space aged singer/songwriter & producer based in Seattle, Washington.

Changer’s album is introspective and reflective in a way that perfectly serves the closeness of a recording like this—when it’s done playing, you might feel like someone just left the room. – Chris Ziegler (LA Record)","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/billychanger","id":"2017-6771856","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6771856.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6771856-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6771856-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6771856.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"Billy Changer","sort_order_within_tier":1570,"video_url":"https://youtu.be/f4hxFVd97-k","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/Billychanger/"},{"home_town":"Missoula, Montana","music_url":"odgymountainmen.bandcamp.com","code":"2017-6503359","website_url":"dodgymountainmen.com","instagram_url":"https://www.instagram.com/dodgymtnmen/","tier":3,"genres":["Americana","Bluegrass","Rock"],"bio":"Dodgy Mountain Men sling a home-brewed Montana Stompgrass that goes down smooth but packs a bite, mixing the rhythms of bluegrass, the soul of the blues and the energy of rock 'n' roll with a plethora of other musical traditions to create a unique electro-acoustic experience. The group's genre-bending experimentation and passion for American roots traditions weave together to emphasize their lyrical storytelling, creating a musical frontier rife with empty mason jars, outlaws, gypsy women and cold Montana storms. Add three distinct frontmen, a pension for sonic exploration and live performances that build to a fever pitch,and you've got a concoction that will make moonshiners proud and compel dancers to wear out the soles of their shoes.\r\n\r\nDMM released their debut album, Stronger than Death, in 2012, and their follow up record, Changing Lanes, is a testament to the evolution of the group from a sideways folk outfit to a fully-recognized band pushing the borders of Americana. Boasting strong dynamics, bold songwriting and a rowdy live-energy feel, Changing Lanes is the work of a band  who has heard the calling of the road and responded with song. Dodgy Mountain Men has toured from coast to coast, bringing their energetic sets to festivals including the John Hartford Memorial Festival (IN), Chinook Festival (WA), Oak Harbor Festival (WA), Spring Blossom (PA), Love Your Mother Earth Festival (MT), Treefort Festival (ID), Red Ants Pants Festival and River City Roots (MT), to name a few. They have also had the pleasure of sharing more intimate stages with acts such as The Devil Makes Three, Greensky Bluegrass, The White Buffalo, Scott H.

The title of STRFKR’s fourth album may seem bleak at first. But hold it in your head a minute, feel its weight, and you may recognize the phrase for what it is: a goal. In the era of the personal brand—amid the FOMO Age—it’s increasingly hard to shed a stifling sense of self, or to just be in the moment that you’re in. Well, consider this an invitation to get blissfully insignificant. That’s what STRFKR founder Joshua Hodges aimed to do when he exiled himself to the desert to create this record, but he returned with his most significant work yet: a set of darkly glistening dance songs rife with sticky beats, earworming hooks, philosophical heft, and bittersweet beauty.\r\n\r\nThe album opens on “Tape Machine,” and the difference is readily apparent. On 2013’s Miracle Mile, STRFKR refined a full-band sound, but this doubles down on and completely reimagines the project’s electronic and pop roots. The initial synths could fuel a rave, and the ensuing groove could score a Drive sequel, but the song is richer still, with cosmic effects flying overhead and a psych-folk earthiness below. It isn’t that the band sat this LP out—drummer (etc.) Keil Corcoran penned the thick astral disco of “In the End,” and he and bassist (etc.) Shawn Glassford both pitch in throughout. But Being No One, Going Nowhere was born in Joshua Tree after Hodges packed up his Los Angeles apartment and moved to that tiny Mojave outpost under the great big sky. “It came together for me in the desert,” he says. “Out there, it’s easy to feel small and slow.”\r\n\r\nWhen Hodges started STRFKR in 2007, it was designed to be success-proof. The name was both unfit for radio and a jab at fame-chasers. But the project was also meant to be bright, playful and brimming with energy. He stumbled upon a winning juxtaposition that’s a STRFKR staple to this day: dark (or heavy) lyrics set to happy music. Hodges credits that to Elliott Smith’s influence, although Being No One, Going Nowhere has closer sonic kin in Italo-disco, kosmische musik and Tony Hoffer’s work with Phoenix, Beck and M83. English thinker/writer Alan Watts, a scholar of Eastern philosophy, was another muse for Hodges—his voice appears on nearly every STRFKR release, including this one. That’s him on “interspace,” talking about sloughing off preconceived identity to find one’s place in the universe, which is the story of Hodges’ eventual career: stop trying—no, start not trying—and succeed.","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/starfucker","id":"2017-6635144","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6635144.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6635144-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6635144-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6635144.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"STRFKR","sort_order_within_tier":20,"video_url":null,"facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/Starfucker"},{"home_town":"Portland, OR","music_url":"https://soundcloud.com/tangoalphatango/sets/white-sugar","code":"2017-6631174","website_url":"http://www.tangoalphatango.com","instagram_url":"http://www.instagram.com/tangoalphatango","tier":2,"genres":["Psychedelic ","Rock"],"bio":"Tango Alpha Tango isn't the band it once was. The tried-and-true riffage and raw psychedelia, once the cornerstones of singer-guitarist Nathan Trueb's particular brand of blues, have recently given way to a more pop-friendly kind of rock, as evident on the band's latest release, White Sugar. Songs like \"I Gotta Girl\" and the title track showcase familiar distortion and chugging electric guitar, though the rest are more polished and subdued. \"People,\" for instance, has a carnivalesque design that banks on a lofty chorus and drummer Joey Harmon's fills, while \"Lonely\" takes a more soulful approach to heartbreak before turning to chiming guitars and an accepting mentality that echos Tom Petty's comeback album, Wildflowers. Trueb's bright guitar work is tighter than ever throughout, lined with fluttering bits of jazz and improvisation that build upon his subtle interplay with his wife, Mirabai, and Harmon. \"I'll take you anyway I please/You might be the last thing that I need,\" he sings over the spare backdrop and gently plucked guitar of \"Gasoline.\" He might be getting softer, but his music is better for it.

They have released six albums and numerous eps and singles, developing a sound that is as compelling as it is divisive. Once intent on taking over the world with noise, they now content themselves with taking it over one room of people at a time. Their music has taken them from the club circuits of Northern Europe to the arenas and dive bars of America; warehouses on the edge of Siberia to airstrips, jungles and all-nighters in the Far East and Australia.  \r\n\r\nOstensibly a touring rock band, 65 have also developed a healthy portfolio of extra-curricular activities while maintaining a decade of peripatetics. Such as ‘Sleepwalk City’ at the Millennium Galleries in Sheffield; a sixteen speaker A/V installation that mashed Google satellite imagery into algorithmic drone fabrication, culminating in a glorious marathon of nine live performances across two nights. \r\n\r\nOther recent projects include music realised as an online real-time re-mix engine (Prisms), a piece of infinite composition released via a freeware coding platform (YrCodeIsBadAndYouShouldFeelBad) and the short experimental film ‘OSCILLATOR’. Past works include a live-soundtrack to the classic sci-fi ‘Silent Running’, sound design for a BBC adaptation of ‘Slaughterhouse Five’ and collaborating on Jean Abreu’s contemporary dance piece ‘Inside’. \r\n\r\nThe band have also completed work on soundtrack for galaxy-spanning phenomenon ‘No Man’s Sky’ – a procedural, open-universe space exploration video game released on Sony Playstation in August 2016. The game has already received high praise, including awards at the 2014 E3 conference for \"Best Original Game\" and \"Best Independent Game\" by a panel of game critics, as well as receiving the \"Special Commendation for Innovation\" title. \r\n\r\nFollowing their critically acclaimed 2013 album ‘Wild Light’, the band released the double album ‘No Man’s Sky: Music For An Infinite’ in August 2016. The album features the official game soundtrack alongside a second album of soundscapes, and has been heralded as one of their most ambitious projects to date.\r\n\r\nAs well as continuing to tour extensively, 65daysofstatic are always working on various secret projects for the weird future.","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/65dos","id":"2017-6762368","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6762368.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6762368-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6762368-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6762368.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"65daysofstatic","sort_order_within_tier":220,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFiweI7_6Do","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/65propaganda/"},{"home_town":"Florence, Italy","music_url":"https://soundcloud.com/clakclakboomclak","code":"2017-6785561","website_url":null,"instagram_url":null,"tier":1,"genres":["Electronic ","Experimental ","Folk"],"bio":"Clap!

The album represents the realization of a vision the two-piece possessed since day one. \r\n\r\nAfter cobbling together demos in the Oakland walk-in closet where Terra slept at the time, the core sessions for Devoted took place in St. Augustine, FL. Terra and Dani spent two weeks in the studio with Jones writing and recording the bulk of material. They finished writing the final three tracks with Omar Rodriguez Lopez (At The Drive-In, The Mars Volta) in Los Angeles. Once the songs were chosen for the record, Jones dug in on production over the next several months, communicating across the country with the duo until the album was a realized vision. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the ten tracks comprising Devoted could be likened to gorgeously haunted transmissions from a bygone era where Portishead and Massive Attack summoned spirits via analog drum machines and battered keyboards. The first single “Ride Or Die” fuses a stark bass hum and droning synth with Terra’s ethereal and evocative delivery before building into an angelic refrain- “All I want… is a Ride Or Die.”","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ritualsofmine","id":"2017-6650140","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6650140.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6650140-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6650140-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6650140.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"Rituals of Mine","sort_order_within_tier":180,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3De0E_1x1Rw","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/ritualsofmine/"},{"home_town":"Boise, ID","music_url":"https://soundcloud.com/thewesternmystics","code":"2017-6464304","website_url":"https://thewesternmystics.bandcamp.com/","instagram_url":"https://www.instagram.com/western_mystics/","tier":3,"genres":["Experimental ","Post- Rock","Psychedelic "],"bio":"On November 11, 2015, The Western Mystics made their first appearance as a duo-baritone guitar trio (with Brent Joel on drums, Nik Kososik on lead baritone and Travis X. Abbott on rhythm baritone) by opening up for the mighty Elder at Neurolux, which would become known as their home venue in many ways. A bootleg recording of this show was released as “Once Upon a Time in the Cosmos”. Shortly after this initial appearance, the mystics added Riley Johnson on keys/vocals and made what many consider to be their true debut at Treefort Music Fest (also at Neurolux) in March of 2016. The band released a recording of this performance as “The Last Western (Live at Treefort 2016)”, which was well-received by listeners. In the words of J.J. Koczan of The Obelisk: “...lush and psychedelic in some places, showcasing encouraging depth of ambiance in quiet stretches with vocals as much as keys and/or baritone guitars, and taking off on flights of classically-styled progressive rock. In short, this is a band capturing the process of finding their sound on stage, live, as it happened.” After their Treefort performance, fellow psych-rockers WEEED invited the mystics to join them on tour for a few dates in Portland and Eugene, Oregon - with both performances being well-received. With this, The Western Mystics established themselves as a band that exists purely within the moment - creating music that embraces the concepts of impermanence and willingness to evolve. The Western Mystics refuse to classify themselves as anything other than human beings conversing with their instruments.","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/WesternMystics","id":"2017-6464304","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6464304.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6464304-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6464304-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6464304.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"The Western Mystics","sort_order_within_tier":2420,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYOS6g0EUD8","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thewesternmystics/"},{"home_town":"Charlottesville, VA","music_url":null,"code":"2017-6763587","website_url":"http://www.thestringdusters.com/","instagram_url":"https://www.instagram.com/stringdusters/","tier":1,"genres":["Bluegrass"],"bio":"Tradition and innovation provide the interlocking roots of bluegrass and its descendents, a lively dance of elements skipping comfortably from ancient jigs to radio ditties to spacious experimentation.  THE INFAMOUS STRINGDUSTERS joyously embody and carry forward the spirit of Bill Monroe, John Hartford, Earl Scruggs, David Bromberg and other originators in their skilled embrace of this music’s twin gravitational pulls, moving dexterously between homespun legacy and creative expansion, a band firmly grounded in what has come before as they grow strong into tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n“What we do is a hybrid of the improvisational and bluegrass worlds.  We take a lot of pride in that.  While our music is our own concept, hopefully it does justice to the amazing components of the bluegrass world,” says Stringdusters Chris Pandolfi.  “We love to present what we do but we always call on the bluegrass world of chops, technique, and traditions.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAMMY-nominated The Infamous Stringdusters - Andy Hall (Dobro), Andy Falco (guitar), Jeremy Garrett (fiddle), Travis Book (double bass), and Pandolfi (banjo) – are as comfortable at a dirt road pickin’ session as they are on an amphitheatre stage, a collection of talents that can whisper and roar as the circumstance demands, responding in real time to their surroundings, working the angles as they ply their craft and raise their sinewy voices with limber grace. \r\n\r\n\r\nEqual parts old school cats and modern operators, the Stringdusters’ latest album, Ladies & Gentlemen (arriving February 5th on Compass Records) spotlights the band’s gift for incorporating guests into their world by rolling out the red carpet for an eclectic array of female singers lending their pipes to a dozen original Stringdusters compositions. \r\n\r\n\r\nHighlighting the group’s instrumental and compositional prowess, the new set opens up fresh spaces including the drum-boosted contemporary country bounce of “Listen” with airwave vet Joan Osborne, the classic Dolly Parton feel “See How Far You’ve Come” with Sara Watkins (Nickel Creek, Watkins Family Hour), the slow jam slink of “Have A Little Faith” with nu-soul belter Joss Stone, the contemporary folk breeze of “I Believe” with Lee Ann Womack, the rousing Americana soar of “Old Whiskey Bottle” with Celia Woodsmith, or the exhilarating style stew of “Hazosphere” with Jennifer Hartswick (Trey Anastasio Band).

Along the way they’ve earned the admiration of a pantheon of critics and rock music peers. The certified classics reach back to Meat Puppets I, II, and Up On The Sun and have been book-ended by recent releases Sewn Together and Lollipop. With brothers Curt and Cris Kirkwood reunited in 2009 and the 2012 release of the band’s graphic tell-all biography, Too High to Die, the Puppets’ iconic status seems assured. But the drive to create goes on and fire still burns; the band’s live shows and new material, including their 14th studio release, Rat Farm (April 16 release via Megaforce Records), are as colorful, vital and undiluted as ever.\r\n\r\nAfter a visit to Russia to perform later this month, the Meat Puppets will be touring the States from March 28 through April 13 (scroll down for complete dates). They’ll also be making select appearances at SxSW and have confirmed for Primavera Festival in Barcelona in May. The touring band consists of the Kirkwood brothers, singer/guitarist Curt Kirkwood and bassist Cris Kirkwood with drummer Shandon Sahm and new addition on second guitar, Elmo Kirkwood (Curt’s son).\r\n\r\nCurt Kirkwood says that fans can expect to hear “real blown-up folk music,” on Rat Farm. Songs like the title track feature the effortless laid-back harmonies, distinctive guitar work and psychedelic, cosmic country sound that they do better than anyone. The Meat Puppets might evolve but their sound is unique – you’ll never mistake them for anyone else, nor anyone else for them, despite their influence. And they make what they do look easy considering that they’re deceptively accomplished players.\r\n\r\n“I tried to write stuff that would stand on its own — just the chords and the melodies, and play it kind of straight,” he says of the Rat Farm material. “I think that was the guiding boundary that I gave myself. It was one of those things where a lot of times, in the past especially, Cris would go, ‘Well, that’s all there is? Let’s put a prog rock part in the middle.’ But I tried to hold it off as much as I could.”\r\n\r\nIt’s those instincts — knowing when to be understated, the confidence that comes with decades of honing your craft — that keep the Meat Puppets pure and relevant. Their sound will never go out of style because they invented their drug-fueled, sunbaked, country-tinged sound. Accept no substitutes.","twitter_url":null,"id":"2017-6769768","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6769768.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6769768-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6769768-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6769768.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"Meat Puppets","sort_order_within_tier":120,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vteYd4SdiHg","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/meatpuppets/"},{"home_town":"Denver, CO","music_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theravenandthewritingdesk/running","code":"2017-6767662","website_url":"http://theravenandthewritingdeskmusic.com/","instagram_url":"https://www.instagram.com/theravenandthewritingdesk/","tier":3,"genres":["Dream Pop","Experimental ","Indie"],"bio":"Nothing stays the same","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/tratwd","id":"2017-6767662","image_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6767662.jpg","image_app_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6767662-app.jpg","image_url_med":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-images/2017-6767662-med.jpg","song_url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treefort-songs/2017-6767662.mp3","forts":["Treefort"],"wave":1,"name":"the Raven and the Writing Desk","sort_order_within_tier":2000,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7btCx1zTHQo","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/theravenandthewritingdesk/"},{"home_town":"Nashville, TN","music_url":"https://alannaroyale.bandcamp.com/","code":"2017-6657029","website_url":"http://www.alannaroyale.com","instagram_url":"http://www.instagram.com/alannaroyale","tier":2,"genres":["Funk","R&B","Soul"],"bio":"Alanna Royale combines the best elements of rock, pop, funk and soul, all executed by their fearless leader and sensual vocalist, Alanna Quinn-Broadus, an unparalleled rhythm section – Jared Colby on guitar, Gabriel Golden on bass and Matt Snow on drums - and a tremendously talented two-piece horn section – Kirk Donovan on trumpet and Diego Vasquez on trombone. \r\n\r\nWithout a single recorded song, Alanna Royale was able to obtain an impressive fan base and a reputation solely because of their unforgettable live performances.

Regrouping in 2013, the band spent Saturday nights playing under a railway bridge in Bermondsey. \r\nRelocating to their affectionately named “Jelly Boy Studios” (a one-time carpentry warehouse and butterfly commune an hour or so outside of London), the band self-produced their debut album and the songs that would become their debut EP.\r\nThe album – “Weird Little Birthday” - was mixed by Adam Lasus (Yo La Tengo, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah) and mastered by the legendary Greg Calbi before being self-released in the UK in June 2014 to great acclaim from NME, Guardian, Sunday Times, Q, Uncut, Stereogum etc. among others. 2 songs from the Weird Little Birthday album (Refrigerate Her and Anything I Do Is All Right) were included in the Chloe Grace Moretz film ‘If I Stay’ which was a No. 3 US box office hit, while Montreal Rock Band Somewhere made it onto acclaimed US TV series The Slap.\r\nSubsequently Happyness signed to Moshi Moshi/PIAS for most of world and to Bar/None Records for N.

Also we felt like we hadn't put a synth in a song for a while, so there's a synth.”\r\nThe EP also includes recent track SB’s Truck – a track penned by the band in homage to Samuel Beckett, who famously used to give the beloved, late, 80’s wrestler André The Giant lifts to school in his truck, owing to him being too large for his dad’s car - and provides a rare direct glimpse into the band’s influences as they offer their own interpretation of Club Gaga’s Friend Of The Revolution.
